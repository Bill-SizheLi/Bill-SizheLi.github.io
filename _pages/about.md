Hi! I'm Sizhe, a fourth-year undergrad at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, majoring in statistics. 
  I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tongxin Li](https://tongxin.me) and [Prof. Nicolas Christianson](https://nicochristianson.com).
  My research interest lies in *Learning-Augmented Online Algorithms* and *Algorithms with Predictions*.
  I was also a visiting student at UC, Berkeley during 2024 Fall.
