Hi! I'm Sizhe, a final-year undergrad at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, majoring in statistics. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tongxin Li](https://tongxin.me) and [Prof. Nicolas Christianson](https://nicochristianson.com).  I was also a visiting student at UC, Berkeley during 2024 Fall.

My research focuses on **learning-augmented online algorithms** and [**algorithms with predictions**](https://algorithms-with-predictions.github.io/). I am particularly interested in *decision-making under uncertainty*, where the challenge is to design algorithms that leverage predictions while maintaining strong worst-case guarantees.
