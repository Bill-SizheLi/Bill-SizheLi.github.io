Hi! I'm Sizhe, a fourth-year undergrad at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, majoring in statistics. 
  I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tongxin Li](https://tongxin.me) and [Prof. Nicolas Christianson](https://nicochristianson.com).
  My research interest lies in *Learning-Augmented Online Algorithms* and *Algorithms with Predictions*.
  I was also a visiting student at UC, Berkeley during 2024 Fall.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
